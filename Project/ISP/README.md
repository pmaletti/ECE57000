# Introduction
Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents *OBS-Diff*, a novel one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. 

Specifically,

1. OBS-Diff revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA heads and FFN neurons) sparsity;

 2. To align the pruning criteria with the iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme, assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error accumulation; 
 3. Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration process. 
 
 Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality.

  <em>Illustration of the proposed <i>OBS-Diff</i> framework applied to the MMDiT architecture. Target modules are first partitioned into a predefined number of <i>module packages</i> and processed sequentially. For each package, hooks capture layer activations during a forward pass with a calibration dataset. This data, combined with weights from a dedicated timestep weighting scheme, is used to construct Hessian matrices. These matrices guide the Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) algorithm to simultaneously prune all layers within the current package before proceeding to the next.</em>

# Quick Start
## 1. Installation
First, install our codebase:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alrightlone/OBS-Diff.git
cd OBS-Diff
```
Then, install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You need to install models (SD3-Medium) from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium) and calibration dataset (GCC3M) from [Conceptual Caption 12M](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions/download).

## 2. Data Preprocessing
To prepare the calibration dataset, we utilize the GCC3M subset.
 Run the following script to format the raw data for the OBS-Diff pruning pipeline:
``` bash
python data/gcc3m_preprocessing.py
```
This step ensures the data is correctly tokenized and organized to facilitate accurate Hessian information estimation during the pruning process.

## 3. Usage

+ Unstructured Pruning For SD3-Medium
```bash
bash ./scripts/OBS_Diff_Unstructured.sh
```
+ N:M Semi-structured Pruning For SD3-Medium
```bash
bash ./scripts/OBS_Diff_Semi.sh
```
+ Structured Pruning For SD3-Medium
```bash
bash ./scripts/OBS_Diff_Structured.sh
```

> Note: You need to change the path to the models and calibration dataset in the scripts and codes.
